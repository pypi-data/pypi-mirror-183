## Description
The project is in stage 1 developing. It is yet to have even basic functionality.

## What to expect...
### ...on 0.1
* Base game is manually specified by the user; it must either be base EU4 folder or overhauled mod folder;
* Generated mod is put locally;
* One province minors generation:
	* Nations take inhabited land, differing on time period;
	* One's name is taken from province it is based on, localization for it is taken from base game;
	* Map color is some deviance from region's color nation is in;
	* Main culture is one that province has;
	* Have generic ideas;
	* No ruler generated.
* Basic flag generation *(e.g. tricolors)* with decent color combinations.

## Pre-release versions in the nutshell
* `x.y.0-alpha.z` - only started developing features promised for `x.y`;
* `x.y.0-beta.z` - features of `x.y` are done in their basis, bugs are possibly easy to find;
* `x.y.0-rc.z` - features of `x.y` are refactored and polished, stage of testing and bugs' hunting.
