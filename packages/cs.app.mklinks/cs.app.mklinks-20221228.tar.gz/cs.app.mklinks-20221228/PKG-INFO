mklinks: tool for finding and hardlinking identical files

*Latest release 20221228*:
* Modernise command, pass a RunState to the merge methods.
* merge: check runstate more frequently, tweak progress bar.
* assimilate: plumb runstate.

Mklinks walks supplied paths looking for files with the same content,
based on a cryptographic checksum of their content. It hardlinks
all such files found, keeping the newest version.

Unlike some rather naive tools out there, mklinks only compares
files with other files of the same size, and is hardlink aware - a
partially hardlinked tree is processed efficiently and correctly.

## Class `FileInfo`

Information about a particular inode.

*Method `FileInfo.__init__(self, dev, ino, size, mtime, paths=())`*:
pylint: disable=too-many-arguments

## Class `Linker`

The class which links files with identical content.

## Function `main(argv=None)`

Main command line programme.

## Class `MKLinksCmd(cs.cmdutils.BaseCommand)`

Main programme command line class.

Command line usage:

    Usage: mklinkscmd paths...
              Hard link files with identical contents.
              -n    No action. Report proposed actions.
