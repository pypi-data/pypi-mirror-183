# Django OAuth Hub

OAuth client and server for Django using [Authlib](https://github.com/lepture/authlib).

**NOTE: This library is still under development and mostly undocumented. It is currently not recommended for use in (production) applications.**

## Features

### OAuth client
- OAuth 1.0
- OAuth 2.0
- OpenID Connect (Discovery)
- Configurable by database
- Multiple clients per OAuth provider

### OAuth server
- OAuth 2.0
- TODO
