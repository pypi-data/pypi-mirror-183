## Used methodology to create this project

This project is made with technique called "AMDD", which a short form of term 'Agile Model Driven Development'

In summary:

1. Model a thing you want to code

2. Write a test to this model

3. Write implementation against written test which was based on a model

This is basically extension of TDD (Test Driven Development) with architecture/modelling SW stuff. My modelling skills still sucks, but I will get better soon (I hope :) )
