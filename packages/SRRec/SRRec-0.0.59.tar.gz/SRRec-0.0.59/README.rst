SRRec: Short Reads restoration through accurate error Rectification
===================================================================
A novel machine-learning-based error correction algorithm SRRec follows the diversity of the PCR and sequencing process to clear errors in short reads, including DNA and RNA sequencing (DNA/RNA-seq), small RNA, unique molecular identifiers (UMI) and amplicon sequencing data.
