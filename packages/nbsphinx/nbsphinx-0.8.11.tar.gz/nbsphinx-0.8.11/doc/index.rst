All content shown below
was generated from Jupyter notebooks,
except for the sections :doc:`a-normal-rst-file`,
:doc:`contributing` and :doc:`version-history`,
which were generated from Sphinx's built-in `reStructuredText`__ format.
The sections
:doc:`custom-formats`,
:doc:`gallery/due-rst` and
:doc:`a-markdown-file`
are using alternative storage formats for Jupyter notebooks,
see :doc:`custom-formats` for details.
