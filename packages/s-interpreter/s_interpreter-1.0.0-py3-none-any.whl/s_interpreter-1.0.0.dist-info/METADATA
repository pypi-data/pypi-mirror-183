## Installation
Install (and update) using `pip`:
```shell
pip install -U s_interpreter
```
or you can clone the repository using `git`:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/SamuelSill/s_interpreter.git
```
## A Simple Example
The following is a program in `S` that always returns the value of `X1`:
```
# Sugar for performing a non-conditional jump
> GOTO {Label L}
        Z <- Z + 1
        IF Z != 0 GOTO {L}

# Sugar for incrementing variable V1 by the value of V2
> {Variable V1} += {Variable V2}
        IF {V2} != 0 GOTO A
        GOTO E
    [A] {V2} <- {V2} - 1
        Z <- Z + 1
        IF {V2} != 0 GOTO A
    [B] Z <- Z - 1
        {V2} <- {V2} + 1
        {V1} <- {V1} + 1
        IF Z != 0 GOTO B
    [E] Y <- Y

# The program starts here
> MAIN
        Y += X1
```
Compiling/Running the program:
```shell
# Compile the program (in file main.slang) to binary file 'output.txt':
s_compiler -f main.slang -b output.txt

# Now 'output.txt' contains *pure* S language code, no sugars.
# Run the interpreter on the binary file on input '42'
s_interpreter -b output.txt 42
```
The console output:
```
Output: 42
```

## The S Compiler

--- 
`The S Compiler` is the central module of this repository.

In short, it allows us to easily compile `slang` files to binaries that the `S Interpreter` can run.

### Compiler Usage
To compile a given `slang` file to a binary file, run the following command:
```shell
s_compiler -f /slang/file/path -o /binary/file/path
```
You could also pass a flag to print the encoding of the program instead, like so:
```shell
s_compiler -f /slang/file/path --encode
```
But be careful, as program encodings can grow incredibly large even with very few instructions, 
so the compiler could throw an error instead.

You could pass the flag `print` to print the program to stdout like so:
```shell
s_compiler -f /slang/file/path --print
```
You can also pass the `verbose` flag for additional prints regarding the compilation process like so:
```shell
s_compiler -f /slang/file/path -o /binary/file/path --verbose
```
You can also provide the input program by passing its encoding (a number) instead of a `slang` file like so:
```shell
s_compiler -d {program-encoding} -o /binary/file/path
```
### Slang Files
In order to compile `S Language` code, 
we write it in `.slang` files as a convention.

Notice that the compiler is inherently case and whitespace insensitive.
The compiler only considers the line continuations between instructions,
and between separate words/variables in the same instruction.

`.slang` files are structured into sections, as follows:
#### MAIN
The `MAIN` section will contain the actual program you wish to compile.
Please note that it must appear at the end of the file.

Take the following example:

```
# This program always returns 'Y = X1' 
> MAIN
        IF X != 0 GOTO A
        Z <- Z + 1
        IF Z != 0 GOTO E
    [A] X <- X - 1
        Y <- Y + 1
        IF X != 0 GOTO A
```
* Again, note that the indentation is only for ease of reading, and the compiler completely ignores it.
#### Sugar Sections
The previous example uses the pattern of the `GOTO L` syntactic sugar.

What if we wanted to use this pattern multiple times?
We can define and use a syntactic sugar like so:
```
> GOTO {Label L}
        Z <- Z + 1
        IF Z != 0 GOTO {L}

> MAIN
        IF X != 0 GOTO A
        GOTO E
    [A] X <- X - 1
        Y <- Y + 1
        IF X != 0 GOTO A
```
A few details to notice:
* Notice that in the definition of the sugar, we specified the type of `L`.
This sugar will only be used if we pass it with a valid label.
* Notice the usage of variable `Z` inside the `GOTO L` sugar.
When the compiler expands the usage of the sugar, 
it replaces all internal variables used in the sugar to variables guaranteed to be unused anywhere else in the program.
The only exception to this rule is with I/O variables (`Y`/`X1`, `X2`, ...). 
They can be manipulated internally from sugar code.
* A given sugar may only use other sugars that are defined before it in the file.
* Sugar definitions are allowed to overlap in terms of their usage patterns. 
  The sugar that will eventually be used in the compiled output is the first in the file that matches the string.

##### Sugar Types
When defining sugars, we need to specify the type of their arguments.

The supported sugar argument types are:
* `Label` - To only match labels
* `Variable` - To only match variables
* `Const` - To only match const numbers (e.g _0, 1, 2, 3,_ ...)
* `Numeric` - To match both variables and consts


_Note that you can overload sugar definitions only differing by the sugar arguments' types!_

While it seems pretty clear as to how `Label`/`Variable` are used, how would one use `Const` in valid S Language?

Well, there is only one way to use a `Const`, and that is with the `REPEAT` statement.
##### REPEAT Statement
Say for example we wanted to implement the sugar for `V += 5`.

Well, we'll just write it like so:

```
> {Variable V} += 5
      {V} <- {V} + 1
      {V} <- {V} + 1
      {V} <- {V} + 1
      {V} <- {V} + 1
      {V} <- {V} + 1
```
But what if we wanted to implement the sugar ` V += k` for ANY const number `k`?

* (Notice the difference here between a const number `k` and a variable `V`.
While on a variable we can perform our regular `S` instructions, 
a const is a value that's known **IN COMPILE-TIME** and is not stored anywhere)
  
In that case, we'd have to use the `REPEAT` statement:

```
> {Variable V} += {Const K}
      {REPEAT K}
      {V} <- {V} + 1
      {END REPEAT}
```
You might be thinking: "This is cheating! REPEAT is not a sugar nor is it a supported instruction!".

Well, as explained before, syntactic sugars are only A CONVENTION 
that we can all agree on when writing `S Language` code.

The `REPEAT` keyword is a convention for consts, that the lines shall be repeated as the size of the const.

If you still think it's cheating, you're welcome to implement `V += k` as many times as you want for different `k`'s.
##### The REPEAT Tradeoff
Currently, the only supported functionality of `Const` types is the `REPEAT` statement.
The initial plan was to implement another functionality called `{REPEAT I TO K}`.

Similarly to `REPEAT`, it would repeat the block `K` times, but it would also allow us to use another
compile-time variable `I`, that would represent the current block repetition index.
This way, we can repeat the block while still changing the behavior of how it generates based 
on the value of const variable `I`.
We could even perform a nested `{REPEAT I}` based on const value `I`.

But we can go even further:
Given a const `K`, we can write a `Python` function that generates different instructions based on `K`'s value! 
After all, sugars are a convention and therefore if we all agree that a given sugar is compiled by the output
of a `Python` function, there should be no problem!

But if we do that, we might as well write our code in `Python` or some other high level language instead of `S`.

So that is why consts only support the `REPEAT` keyword.
Any additional keyword that we add will remove us of the challenge of writing in `S`, and defeat the purpose altogether.

You can still do meta-programming in `S` if you want though. Just not with consts 
(as `S` does not natively support them).
##### The Numeric Type
While the `Const` type helps reduce code repetition, 
there could still be code repetition between const/variable implementations.

Suppose we've already implemented sugars for `V <- 0` and `V1 += V2`, 
and now we wish to implement `V1 <- V2`.

The straightforward approach would be to implement it as follows:

```
> {Variable V1} <- {Variable V2}
      {V1} <- 0
      {V1} += {V2}
```
This implementation works fine, but now we decide to implement the same for consts.
So we implement the sugar `V += K`, and now we need to implement `V <- K`:

```
> {Variable V} <- {Const K}
      {V} <- 0
      {V} += {K}
```
But notice the code repetition between the two implementations! Yuck!

Well, `Numeric` comes to the rescue:
```
> {Variable V} <- {Numeric N}
      {V} <- 0
      {V} += {N}
```
The numeric helps us create the two implementations at once!
This works as intended. When we use the sugar for consts, the compiler uses sugar `V += K` to expand the second line, 
and when we use the sugar for variables, it uses `V1 += V2`.

You might think this is pretty minor, but imagine you wanted to implement `V1 <- V2 + V3`. 
You'd have to implement the same sugar 4 times to allow for both const/variable usages.
##### The Pitfalls of Sugars
###### Sugar Argument Edge Cases
Suppose you've implemented the sugars `{Variable V} <- {Const K}` and `{Variable V1} -= {Variable V2}` correctly, 
and you wish to use them to implement the sugar `{Variable OUT} <- {Const K} - {Variable V}`.

Well, the straightforward approach is to implement it like so:
```
> {Variable OUT} <- {Const K} - {Variable V}
        {OUT} <- {K}
        {OUT} -= {V}
```
But there's an edge case here that needs to be addressed. Can you see it?

What if we expand the line `Z <- 100 - Z`?
It would expand to:
```
Z <- 100
Z -= Z
```
No matter the initial value of `Z`, the given lines will set it to `0`!

So let's fix the case for when `V` is the same variable as `OUT`:

```
> {Variable OUT} <- {Const K} - {Variable V}
        Z <- {V}
        {OUT} <- {K}
        {OUT} -= Z
```
Now you may argue that copying the value of `V` to `Z` 
in the common case where `OUT` is not the same variable as `V` is inefficient.

That would be quite silly of you, 
as it's funny to argue about efficiency in this language to begin with, but you'd still be right.

Well we can add an exception to this case! We can overload the sugar like so:
```
> {Variable OUT} <- {Const K} - {Variable OUT}
        Z <- {OUT}
        {OUT} <- {K}
        {OUT} -= Z

> {Variable OUT} <- {Const K} - {Variable V}
        {OUT} <- {K}
        {OUT} -= {V}
```
The order here **MATTERS**!
As explained previously, the sugar chosen to expand a given line will be the **first in the file** that matches it.
If declared the other way around, the more general-case sugar will always take place, 
and we'll be left with the same bug we started with.
###### Sugar Internal Variables
Suppose you wished to initialize a given variable `Z` to `5` in the `MAIN` section.

You could simply write it as `Z <- Z + 1` `5` times. After all, `Z` is initialized to `0`, 
so we don't need to set it to `0` beforehand.

But what about sugars?
You might think that it's safe to do the same with sugars, as the compiler guarantees
that the sugar's internal variables are not used anywhere else in the program.

Well, while you may be right that the compiler takes care of us 
with regard to the uniqueness of the variables, a problem may still occur 
if the sugar is used inside a loop.

Let's see an example.

Suppose you've implemented `{Variable V1} <- {Variable V2}` correctly. 
Let's look at the following code:
```
> {Variable OUT} <- 1
      Z <- Z + 1
      {OUT} <- Z

> MAIN
  [A] Y <- 1
      X <- X - 1
      IF X != 0 GOTO A
```
You would assume for input `X = 2` the value of `Y` would be `1`.
But it would actually be `2`, as the lines that `Y <- 1` is expanded to work with the same variable, 
whatever the compiler may choose it to be.

Of course this issue would not be present if we were to write our `MAIN` section like so:
```
> MAIN
    Y <- 1
    Y <- 1
```
This code will in fact always return 1, as the two lines expand to different lines, 
hence with different `Z` variables.

Sugar local variables may seem to behave like static variables initialized to `0` at first, 
but they're only shared between different 'calls' to the same occurrence of the sugar in our code.

As a result of this, a guideline for writing your sugars should be to 
make sure the internal variables you use are initialized to `0`, 
either by actively zero-ing them at the start of the sugar, or by zero-ing them before exiting the sugar.

You don't have to do that though if you don't actually care about the exact value of your variable (e.g `GOTO L`). 

### The Algorithm
#### Sugar Parsing
Firstly, the compiler parses the different sugar sections and generates regex patterns 
that would detect potential usages for each sugar.
It also validates the sugar's most basic syntax, 
like making sure that for each `REPEAT` keyword comes an `END REPEAT` eventually.

#### Compiling The Code
The compiler starts with the `MAIN` section.

It goes over each instruction in the section:
- If it's a supported `S` instruction, just compile it as usual
- Otherwise, go over all known sugars in order, and find the first matching sugar.
  - If there is none, the program does not compile.
  - Otherwise, the compiler saves the sugar and its matching occurrence for later compilation.

The compiler then goes over all sugars that were saved for later compilation and
expands each sugar in-place (using the previously compiled instructions to avoid name collision).

#### Sugar Expansion
The sugar expansion algorithm is probably where most of the brains of the compiler lies.

It's a bit too intricate to be discussed here, 
so it is recommended you read the algorithm in file [compiler.py](src/s_interpreter/compiler.py), under the `SyntacticSugar.compile` function.

## The S Interpreter
While the `S Compiler` does all the work of compiling `.slang` files to binaries,
the interpreter's purpose is only to run those compiled binaries.

### Interpreter Usage
To run the interpreter on a given binary file, run the following command:
```shell
s_interpreter <x1-input> <x2-input> ... <xn-input> -b /binary/file/path
```
The interpreter will print out the result of the binary on the given input (variable `Y`).

You could also pass an additional flag to print extra info about the run performed like so:
```shell
s_interpreter <x1-input> <x2-input> ... <xn-input> -b /binary/file/path --run_info
```
## The S Language

---
`The S Language` is a [model of computation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_of_computation) 
that is taught in course _Theory of Computation_ at _The Academic College of Tel Aviv, Israel_.
### The Model
#### Variables
The main thing to note about the `S Language`, is that it only supports non-negative integers.

The language supports three different variable types:
- **Input Variables**: `X1`/`X`, `X2`, `X3`...
- **Temporary/Work Variables**: `Z1`/`Z`, `Z2`, `Z3`...
- **One Output Variable**: `Y1`/`Y`
#### Labels
You can mark instructions in the `S Language` with labels.

The label names could only be of the following:

`A1`/`A`, `B1`/`B`, `C1`/`C`, `D1`/`D`, `E1`/`E`,
`A2`, `B2`, ..., `E2`, `A3`, `B3`, ...
#### Instructions
`The S Language` only supports 4 different instructions:

Given any variable `V` and label `L`:
- `V <- V` - A blank instruction (do nothing)
- `V <- V + 1` - Increment `V` by 1
- `V <- V - 1` - If `V` is `0` do nothing, Otherwise decrement `V` by 1
- `IF V != 0 GOTO L` - If `V` isn't `0`, jump to the first occurrence of label `L` (if nonexistent the program exits), 
  otherwise continue from the next instruction.
#### The Program
A program written in the `S Language` is composed of a series of instructions, with or without labels.

At the start of the program, all variables are initialized to `0`.

Only the input variables (`X1`, `X2`, ...) are initialized with the user input. 
All input variables that weren't given before running the program are also initialized to `0`.

A given program may behave in one of two ways:
- Run infinitely, in which case it returns nothing
- Finish running, in which case ONLY the value of variable `Y` is returned

The program runs the instructions sequentially one after the other (unless a jump is performed), 
and may exit by two ways:
- If it reaches the end of the program
- If it performs a jump to a nonexistent _label_.
#### Example
Let's write a program that always returns the value of its first input (`X1`).

Our first approach would be to write something like this:
```
[A] X <- X - 1
    Y <- Y + 1
    IF X != 0 GOTO A
```
This program does the trick for all inputs except for `X = 0`.

Let's fix the edge case:
```
    IF X != 0 GOTO A
    Z <- Z + 1
    IF Z != 0 GOTO E
[A] X <- X - 1
    Y <- Y + 1
    IF X != 0 GOTO A
```
Notice that in order to jump unconditionally to non-existent label `E` (and therefore exit), 
we had to increment a temporary variable to make sure it's not `0`.
#### Syntactic Sugars
Due to the simplicity of the `S Language`, we might want to define conventions 
for patterns that often appear in our code.

Take for example the unconditional jump pattern to some label `L`:
```
Z <- Z + 1
IF Z != 0 GOTO L
```
We can agree that whenever someone writes `GOTO L` in their program, it would mean that they wrote the above pattern.

Of course the `Z` variable would have to be unique and unused anywhere in the program, and not hard-coded `Z`.
We wouldn't want our sugars to change the rest of the program's functionality.

This **DOES NOT MEAN that** `GOTO L` is now a supported instruction in the `S Language`. 
It's just a convention between us programmers. 

To compile a program that uses syntactic sugars, 
we'd still need to expand them to their underlying instructions.

The syntactic sugars will allow us to write higher level code while still respecting the language's restrictions.
### Encoding
Since our language only supports integers, 
we might want to encode structured data into integers so that we can process it.
#### PairWise
If we wish to encode the pair _<a, b>_ where `a`, `b` are non-negative integers, we follow the formula:

$$\left< a, b \right> = 2^a(2b + 1) - 1$$
#### ListWise
If we wish to encode the list _[e<sub>1</sub>, e<sub>2</sub>, ..., e<sub>n</sub>]_, 
where all elements are non-negative integers, we follow the formula:

$$[e_1, e_2, ..., e_n] = \sum_{i=1}^n p_i^{e_i}$$

Where _p<sub>i</sub>_ is the prime at position _i_ (e.g p<sub>1</sub>=2, p<sub>3</sub>=5)

* Notice that adding _0_ to the end of the list does not change its encoding.
Therefore, if we wish to know the length of the list, we assume it won't end with _0_ elements.
#### Instruction Encoding
<ins>Encoding Variables</ins>: If we wish to encode a given variable, 
we just look at its index in the following sequence:

`Y`, `X1`, `Z1`, `X2`, `Z2`, `X3`, `Z3`, ...

* For example, `#Y` = 1, `#Z2` = 5 etc.

<ins>Encoding Labels</ins>: If we wish to encode a given label, we just look at its index in the following sequence:

`A1`, `B1`, `C1`, `D1`, `E1`, `A2`, `B2`, ...

* For example, `A1` = 1, `#C1` = 3 etc.

<ins>Encoding Instructions:</ins> If we wish to encode a given instruction (with or without label), 
it is encoded as _<a, <b, c>>_, where:

- <ins>**_a_**</ins>:
  - _0_ if the instruction has no label 
  - Otherwise the encoding of the label
- <ins>**_b_**</ins>: 
  - _0_ if `V <- V`
  - _1_ if `V <- V + 1`
  - _2_ if `V <- V - 1`
  - (_2_ + `#L`) if `IF V != 0 GOTO L` 
- <ins>**_c_**</ins>: `#V` - _1_ where `V` is the variable in the instruction
#### Program Encoding
If we wish to encode the program:
```
I1
I2
.
.
.
In
```

We just follow the formula:

\#[\#_I<sub>1</sub>_, \#_I<sub>2</sub>_, ..., \#_I<sub>n</sub>_] - _1_

* Notice that the encoding for `Y <- Y` is 0.
  This means that adding such instruction without a label to the end of a program **will not** change its encoding.
  This is problematic, so as a convention, no program will end with `Y <- Y` without a label.
### Conventions
- If the index of a variable/label is 1, we can omit it.
- No program will end with a non-labeled `Y <- Y` instruction.
- Although it's not mandatory, label `E` (`E1`) is never used as a label of an instruction,
  so that we can always jump to it if we wish to exit the program.
