# Pro-Football-Talk Web Scraper

Developed by Devon Connors (c) 2022

## Before Continuing:
<strong><u>Out of respect for Pro Football Reference</u></strong> each instance of scraping will have a 5-10 second delay as to not spam their server.  So in the instances where you obtain a list of URLs of players to scrape you will need to understand it could take some time to process that list.

##### Example: 400 players could take up to 1 hour to scrape.

I am working through updating this tool to use asyncronous request while also being respectful so for the time being please be patient.

## Examples of How To Use (Alpha Version)

### Scraping Team Data
#### Creating Team Data Scraper and Method Usage
```python
from PFRWebScraper import ScrapeTeamData

# Creates an instance of Team Data Scraper
team_data_scraper = ScrapeTeamData()

# Obtains the abbreviation for the team you wish to scrape
team_abbreviation = team_data_scraper.get_team_abbreviation("Las Vegas Raiders")

# Scrapes defensive data for the team for a number of years back.  
#   Uses 4 years by default.
default_defensive_data = team_data_scraper.scrape_defense(team_abbreviation)

# Scrapes defensive data for the team's last 2 years
last_two_years_defense_data = team_data_scraper.scrape_defense(team_abbreviation, 2)

# # Scrapes offensive data for the team for a number of years back.  
#   Uses 4 years by default.
default_offensive_data = team_data_scraper.scrape_offense(team_abbreviation)

# Scrapes offensive data for the team's last 2 years
last_two_years_offensive_data = team_data_scraper.scrape_offense(team_abbreviation, 2)
```

#### Obtaining Specific Data From The Team Data Object
```python
from PFRWebScraper import ScrapeTeamData

# Creates an instance of Team Data Scraper
team_data_scraper = ScrapeTeamData()

# Obtains the abbreviation for the team you wish to scrape
team_abbreviation = team_data_scraper.get_team_abbreviation("Las Vegas Raiders")

# Scrapes offensive data for the team's last 2 years
offensive_data = team_data_scraper.scrape_offense(team_abbreviation, 2)

# Obtains the years that returned data if you are unsure
# In this instance you will receive a list: 
#   [2021, 2022]
valid_years_with_data = offensive_data.get_list_of_years()

# You will then need to set the year from which you will like data
offensive_data.set_reference_year(2022)

# After you have set the reference year you can begin pulling stats
team_points = offensive_data.get_points()
team_total_yards = offensive_data.get_total_yards()
```

#### Obtaining Whole Data Sets
```python
from PFRWebScraper import ScrapeTeamData

# Creates an instance of Team Data Scraper
team_data_scraper = ScrapeTeamData()

# Obtains the abbreviation for the team you wish to scrape
team_abbreviation = team_data_scraper.get_team_abbreviation("Las Vegas Raiders")

# Scrapes offensive data for the team's last 2 years
offensive_data = team_data_scraper.scrape_offense(team_abbreviation, 2)

# Obtains the raw data as a Pandas Dataframe
offensive_dataframe = team_data_scraper.get_dataframe_of_stats()

# Obtains the raw data as a dictionary
offensive_dictionary = team_data_scraper.get_dictionary_of_stats()
```

### Scraping Player Data

# You can also specify the sections of data you would like. You pass them in as a list.
# This is set to all data by default. 
# Different Input: 
#   1. 'passing' - Scrapes Regular Season and Playoff data on a passer.
#   2. 'advanced' - Scrapes Air Yards, Accuracy, Pressure, and Play Type data on a passer.
#   3. 'adjusted' - Scrapes Adjusted data on a passer.
