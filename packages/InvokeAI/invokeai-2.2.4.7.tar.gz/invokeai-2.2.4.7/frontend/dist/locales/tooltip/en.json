  "feature": {
    "prompt": "This field will take all prompt text, including both content and stylistic terms. While weights can be included in the prompt, standard CLI Commands/parameters will not work.",
    "gallery": "As new invocations are generated, files from the output directory will be displayed here. Generations have additional options to configure new generations.",
    "other": "These options will enable alternative processing modes for Invoke. Seamless tiling will work to generate repeating patterns in the output. High Resolution Optimization performs a two-step generation cycle, and should be used at higher resolutions when you desire a more coherent image/composition.",
    "seed": "Seed values provide an initial set of noise which guide the denoising process, and can be randomized or populated with a seed from a previous invocation. The Threshold feature can be used to mitigate undesirable outcomes at higher CFG values (try between 0-10), and Perlin can be used to add Perlin noise into the denoising process - Both serve to add variation to your outputs.",
    "variations": "Try a variation with an amount of between 0 and 1 to change the output image for the set seed - Interesting variations on the seed are found between 0.1 and 0.3.",
    "upscale": "Using ESRGAN you can increase the output resolution without requiring a higher width/height in the initial generation.",
    "faceCorrection": "Using GFPGAN or Codeformer, Face Correction will attempt to identify faces in outputs, and correct any defects/abnormalities. Higher strength values will apply a stronger corrective pressure on outputs, resulting in more appealing faces. With Codeformer, a higher fidelity will attempt to preserve the original image, at the expense of face correction strength.",
    "imageToImage": "Image to Image allows the upload of an initial image, which InvokeAI will use to guide the generation process, along with a prompt. A lower value for this setting will more closely resemble the original image. Values between 0-1 are accepted, and a range of .25-.75 is recommended.",
    "boundingBox": "The bounding box is analogous to the Width and Height settings for Text to Image or Image to Image. Only the area in the box will be processed.",
    "seamCorrection": "Control the handling of visible seams which may occur when a generated image is pasted back onto the canvas.",
    "infillAndScaling": "Manage infill methods (used on masked or erased areas of the canvas) and scaling (useful for small bounding box sizes)."
