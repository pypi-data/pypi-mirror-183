                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or

              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,

              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,

              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

# Yogger

[Yogger](https://github.com/yaphott/yogger) aims to provide an ideal logging setup with utilities to effectively represent interpreter stacks.

> Supports `requests.Request` and `requests.Response` objects if the **Requests** package is installed.

### Requirements:

**Yogger** requires Python 3.9 or higher, is platform independent, and requires no outside dependencies.

## Installing

Most stable version from [**PyPi**](https://pypi.org/project/yogger/):

```bash
pip install yogger
```

Development version from [**GitHub**](https://github.com/yaphott/yogger):

```bash
git clone git+https://github.com/yaphott/yogger.git
cd yogger
pip install .
```

## Usage

Import packages and instantiate a logger:

```python
import logging
import yogger

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
```

Install the logger class and configure with your package name:

> Place at the start of the top-level function.

```python
def _cli():
    yogger.install()
    yogger.configure(__name__, verbosity=1)
```

### Output

Example of logger output:

```text
[ 2022-11-17 10:16:09.0918  INFO  yourapplication ]  Something we want to log.
[ 2022-11-17 10:16:09.0918  DEBUG  yourapplication ]  Something we want to log.
[ 2022-11-17 10:16:09.0918  WARNING  yourapplication ]  Something we want to log.
[ 2022-11-17 10:16:09.0918  ERROR  yourapplication ]  Something we want to log.
[ 2022-11-17 10:16:09.0918  CRITICAL  yourapplication ]  Something we want to log.
```

Example of dictionary representation in dump:

```python
example = {
    "user_id": 123456790,
    "profile": {
        "name": "John Doe",
        "birthdate": datetime.date(2000, 1, 1),
        "weight_kg": 86.18,
    },
    "video_ids": [123, 456, 789],
}
```

```text
example = <builtins.dict>
  example['user_id'] = 123456790
  example['profile'] = <builtins.dict>
    example['profile']['name'] = 'John Doe'
    example['profile']['birthdate'] = datetime.date(2000, 1, 1)
    example['profile']['weight_kg'] = 86.18
  example['video_ids'] = [123, 456, 789]
```

Similarly for a dataclass:

```python
@dataclasses.dataclass
class Example:
    user_id: int
    profile: dict[str, str | float | datetime.date]
    video_ids: list[int]
```

```text
example = <yourapplication.Example>
  example.user_id = 'user_id' = example.user_id = 123456790
  example.profile = 'profile' = example.profile = <builtins.dict>
    example.profile['name'] = 'John Doe'
    example.profile['birthdate'] = datetime.date(2000, 1, 1)
    example.profile['weight_kg'] = 86.18
  example.video_ids = 'video_ids' = example.video_ids = [123, 456, 789]
```

### About the `package_name` parameter

The `package_name` parameter gives Yogger an idea of what belongs to your application. This name is used to identify which frames to dump in the stack. So it’s important what you provide there. If you are using a single module, `__name__` is always the correct value. If you are using a package, it’s usually recommended to hardcode the name of your package there.

For example, if your application is defined in "yourapplication/app.py", you should create it with one of the two versions below:

```python
yogger.configure("yourapplication")
```

```python
yogger.configure(__name__.split(".")[0])
```

Why is that? The application will work even with `__name__`, thanks to how resources are looked up. However, it will make debugging more painful. Yogger makes assumptions based on the import name of your application. If the import name is not properly set up, that debugging information may be lost.

## Support for dumping the stack

### Traces and exceptions

Using the `dump_on_exception` **context manager** dumps the exception and trace if an exception is raised:

```python
with yogger.dump_on_exception(
    # Uncomment to override
    # dump_path="./stack_dump.txt",
):
    raise SomeException
```

This is nearly equivalent to:

```python
import inspect
```

```python
try:
    raise SomeException
except Exception as e:
    trace = inspect.trace()
    if len(trace) > 1:
        with open("./stack_dump.txt", mode="a", encoding="utf-8") as f:
            yogger.dump(f, trace[1:], e=e, package_name="yourapplication")
```

### Stacks

Setting `dump_locals=True` when running `yogger.configure` dumps a representation of the caller's stack upon logging with a level of warning or higher.

To manually dump the stack, something like this would suffice:

```python
import inspect
```

```python
stack = inspect.stack()
if len(stack) > 2:
    with open("./example.log", mode="w", encoding="utf-8") as fp:
        yogger.dump(fp, stack[2:][::-1])
```

If you simply want the string representation, use the `yogger.dumps` function:

```python
stack = inspect.stack()
if len(stack) > 2:
    trace_repr = yogger.dumps(stack[2:][::-1])
```
