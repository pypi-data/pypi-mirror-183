======
Readme
======

This is a toolbox in form of a python package that handles algorithms to be used in dsp (digital signal processing) projects.

It is a personal project that is under active development and it will take some time until it reaches a certain level of maturity.
If you find some implementations interesting or useful, please feel free to use it for your projects and expand or change
functionalities.

Getting Started
===============

Check out the `examples`_ for some basic examples of the dsptoolbox package
and refer to the documentation for the complete description of classes and methods.

.. note::
    The documentation at `read the docs`_ is available but not working completely without errors
    because of a bug in one of the modules needed to build the package. This will be fixed in the future.
    Until then, please refer to the other available documentation.

Installation
============

Use pip to install dsptoolbox

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install dsptoolbox

(Requires Python 3.10 or higher)
