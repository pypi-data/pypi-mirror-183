**Note:** Currently `text-davinci-003` model is used as a chat backend. Unfortunately API for chatGPT is not yet provided by OpenAI.


## Installation

`poetry` is required to install the package from the source code. You can get it [here](https://python-poetry.org/docs/)

Once `poetry` is enabled in the system, to install the project and its dependencies, execute following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mikkac/bro_listen.git && cd bro_listen && poetry install
```

## Configuration

After installation, configuration file has to be provided.
Default location used by the application is `$HOME/.config/bro_listen/config.toml`. <br>
One can use the default [configuration file](https://github.com/mikkac/bro_listen/blob/master/src/bro_listen/config.toml). The only thing that needs to be provided is OpenAI API key that can be generated [here](https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys).

### Configuration details

Application supports several configuration parameters.
* `voice_api` - Voice recognition API. Currently only `"vosk"` is supported, but it's planned to also enable usage of [Google Speech-To-Text](https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text) and [Azure Speech to text](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/cognitive-services/speech-to-text/).
* `language` - language used by `voice_api`. Currently available languages are listed in [Vosk's documentation](https://github.com/alphacep/vosk-api).
* `enable_audio_response` - chat's responses are only written to console by default. However, it's possible to vocalize them by setting this parameter to `true`.
* `device_id` - ID of recording device. It should be commented out or completely removed from configuration if default device shall be used.

## Usage

Once configuration file has been provided, start the application with command:
```bash
poetry run bro_listen
```
or

```bash
poetry shell
bro_listen
```
