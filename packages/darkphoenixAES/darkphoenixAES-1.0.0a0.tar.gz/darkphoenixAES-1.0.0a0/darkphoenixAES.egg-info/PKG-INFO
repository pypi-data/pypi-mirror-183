# DarkPhoenix

*The Phoenix became Dark Phoenix due to allowing human emotions to cloud its judgment. In this state, Phoenix was the strongest, but also an evil entity that thirsted for power and destruction. Totally uncontrollable, Dark Phoenix was a force to be reckoned with as it was not bound by a human conscience.*

DarkPhoenix is a tool to perform differential fault analysis attacks (DFA) against AES whiteboxes **with external encodings**, as described in

- *A DFA Attack on White-Box Implementations of AES with External Encodings*, Alessandro Amadori, Wil Michiels, Peter Roelse [1]
