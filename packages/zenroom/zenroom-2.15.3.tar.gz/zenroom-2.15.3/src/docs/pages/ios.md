# Use Zenroom as a library for iOS 

- Get the latest build of the lib on the [download page](https://zenroom.org/#downloads)
- Get the latest [zenroom.h](https://github.com/DECODEproject/Zenroom/blob/master/src/zenroom.h)
 - And make sure you add **#include <stddef.h>** to zenroom.h
- For a sample of the implementation, check the [decode app](https://github.com/dyne/decode-proximity-app/blob/master/ios/Zenroom.m#L31)
