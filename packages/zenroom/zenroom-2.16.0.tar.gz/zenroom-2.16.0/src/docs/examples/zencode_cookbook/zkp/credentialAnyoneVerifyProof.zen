Scenario credential: verify proof
    Given that I have a 'issuer public key' inside 'MadHatter'
    and I have a 'credential proof'
    When I aggregate all the issuer public keys
    When I verify the credential proof
    then print the string 'the proof matches the public_key! So you can add zencode after the verify statement, that will execute only if the match occurs.'
