Scenario credential
Scenario petition: aggregate signature
    Given that I have a 'petition signature'
    Given I have a 'petition'
    Given I have a 'issuer public key'
    When the petition signature is not a duplicate
    When the petition signature is just one more
    When I add the signature to the petition
    and I aggregate all the issuer public keys
    Then print the 'petition'
    Then print the 'issuer public key'
