Scenario 'ecdh': Decrypt the message with the password

# Here we load the encrypted secret message along with the password
Given that I have a valid 'secret message'
Given that I have a 'string' named 'password' inside 'mySecretStuff'

# Here the decryption happens, we'll also rename the output.
When I decrypt the text of 'secret message' with 'password'
When I rename the 'text' to 'textDecrypted'

# And here we print out the decrypted message
Then print the 'textDecrypted' as 'string'
