Scenario credential: Centralized credential issuance
Given that I am known as 'MadHatter'
and I have my 'keyring'
When I create the credential key
and I create the credential request
and I create the credential signature
and I create the credentials
When I remove the 'issuer' from 'keyring'
Then print the 'credentials'
and print the 'keyring'
