# RESTroom-mw: exposes a dynamic REST endpoints from Zencode smart contracts


RESTroom is a portmanteau of **REST** and **Zenroom**, it exposes dynamic REST endpoints, from **Zencode smart contracts**, stored in files. 

Using RESTroom you can for example:

* Create web services by just copying a zencode file into a directory
* Expose hardened cryptographic operations, written in a natural English-like programming language) that is understandable to non-programmers and to every stakeholders
* Augment Zencode by adding custom actions and operations
* Create your own domain specific language powered by Zenroom to execute cryptographic operations and more
