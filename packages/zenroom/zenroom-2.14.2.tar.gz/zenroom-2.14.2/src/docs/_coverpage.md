- 
<span class="small-caps">zenroom</span> is a small, portable and **secure language interpreter** of a domain specific language called <span class="small-caps">zencode</span>, able to <a href="https://zenroom.org/#features" target="_blank" alt="Features" style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration:underline !important;">execute cryptographic operations</a> and smart contracts in a multiplatform environment.


<!--
- The <span class="small-caps">zenroom vm</span> is very small, has **no external dependency**, is fully deterministic and ready to run **end-to-end encryption** on any platform:
desktop, embedded, mobile, cloud and even web browsers.


- **zenCode** is the name of the <span class="small-caps">dsl</span> executed by <span class="small-caps">zenroom</span>: it is similar to human language and can process large data structures while operating cryptographic transformations and basic logical operations on them.



<span class="small-caps">zenroom</span> _is licensed as <span class="small-caps">agpl</span>v3 we are happy to discuss dual-licensing on a commercial base._
