# pygraph
Learning graph algorithms. Inspired by the numerous
breadth first search problems in advent of code reminding
me of the Algorithms course I took way back then.

## Graph
The basic Graph object. Contains a list of nodes and edges.

## BFSearch
Breadth first search

## DFSearch
Depth first search

## Draw
Draws the graph and a given path on it using graphviz with neato layout
