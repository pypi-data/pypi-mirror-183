# Time-Dependent Metrics to Assess Performance Prediction Systems

### Installation
````
pip install assess_pps
````

### Get started
```Python
# Importing our library
from assess_pps import metrics as m

# for working with data we need pandas
import pandas as pd

# implementing csv files
ectel = pd.read_csv("D:/path")  # put your link here
ectelsys2 = pd.read_csv("D:/path")

# We use the file ectel.csv for testing.
prediction_time = 35  # till which week we should search the overall stability value
ectel_temp = ectel.loc[ectel.weeknumber <= prediction_time]  # dataframe with all data till predicted time
S = ectel_temp['idUser'].unique()  # list with student indexes
Y = [0, 1, 2]  # list of classes
x = 10  # x  earliest times of correct predictions

# Stability 
stability = m.Stability(ectel_temp, S)
print("Stability: ", stability)

# Accuracy
accuracy = m.Accuracy(ectel_temp, S)
print("Accuracy: ", accuracy)

# Earliness 
earliness = m.Earliness_Total(S, Y, x, ectel_temp)
print("Earliness: ", earliness)

# ESS 
# for ESS we need to know stability and earliness
ESS = m.ESS(stability, earliness)
print("ESS of average earliness: ", ESS)

# EAS 
# for EAS we need to know accuracy and earliness
EAS = m.EAS(accuracy, earliness)
print("EAS of average earliness: ", EAS)
```
