Operation Searchlight, specially targetting Bengali Hindus and nationalists, began on this day. It marked the beginning of the genocide in bangladesh as well as the Bangla war of liberation. Members of the Pakistani military and supporting Islamist militias from Jamaat-e-Islami (lit. Collective of Islamists) killed up to 3 million people, raped between 200k and 400k Bengali women. A further eight to ten million people, mostly Hindus, fled to India.

Of course, the operation failed and backfired, as India under Indira Gandhi intervened and utterly defeated the Islamic republic's military.

Contemporary report by Ted Kennedy: "Hardest hit have been members of the Hindu community who have been robbed of their lands and shops, systematically slaughtered, and in some places, painted with yellow patches marked H. All of this has been officially sanctioned, ordered and implemented under martial law from Islamabad".
