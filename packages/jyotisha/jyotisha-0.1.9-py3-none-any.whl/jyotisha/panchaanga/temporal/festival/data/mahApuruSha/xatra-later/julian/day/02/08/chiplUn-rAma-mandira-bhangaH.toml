Svami Brahmendra had built a large temple of the bhArgava on hill near
Chiplun, which was lavishly endowed by the Hindus of the Maharatta
country. In 1727, the Siddi admiral, Siddi Sat, launched a naval raid on
the adjacent territory of Govalkot and Anjanvel, annexed them and
fortified them for an offensive on the Hindus. The African imitator of
his Arab role-models was seized with an itch to become a Ghazi and be
recognized as a pre-eminent Moslem. So on Shivaratri day, Feb 8th 1727,
he launched a Jihad to attack the Rama temple on the Chiplun hill.
Having desecrated the idols he rounded up several hundred brAhmaNas and
tortured them and killed many of them. This attack enraged the Hindus
who called upon Shahu to take the strongest action.
