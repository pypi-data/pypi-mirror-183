sambhAji mahArAj, aged 32, was brutally tortured and killed by awrangzeb at tulApur (where his grandfather shAhAjI had done the tulAgaja vidhi, donating an elephant’s weight in gold). While given to debauchery, sambhAjI shared his father's vision of hindavI svarAjya (refer his letter to rAmasiMha of mevAr) and was well versed in sanskrit.

Per marATha accounts: Sambhaji was told that if he converted to Islam and spent his life as a servant of the emperor he could see life. Sambhaji made it clear that the Alamgir was the worst enemy of the country and the Padishaw was a real fool to follow a mentally ill person as his only prophet. Awrangzeb decided to execute him on hearing his reply. sambhAjI said he would sacrifice his life as an offering to the great mahAdeva. His tongue was cut out and fed to a dog. Then his eyes were gouged out and limbs cut. His heart was pulled out and finally the head was cut. Body parts which were left over from feeding dogs were then paraded through major cities in a procession.

Background: Sambhaji's positions were spied upon by his own relations, the Shirke family, who had defected to the Mughals. Sambhaji and 25 of his advisors (including kavi kalash) were captured by the Mughal forces of Muqarrab Khan in a skirmish at Sangameshwar in February 1689. Earlier in his life he had escaped the clutches of Awrangzeb at Agra with his father shivAjI.
