Lazy Ghost Hunters
==================

Ghost Hunters is a little game edited by Smart Games.
The goal of the game is to light six ghosts arranged on a 4x4 grid with 6 transparent covers of different sizes on which are drawn 0, 1 or 2 torches.

The goal of this program is to determine the solution. When the program is launched, indicate 4 rows of 4 numbers 0 (no ghost) or 1 (ghost) to indicate the arrangement of the ghosts. The solution will appear with "o" for the ghosts and colored arrows for the torches.
