# Network Utils
Network utils is a library designed to help make writing socket programs easier.
It has builtin methods for setting up hybrid encryption as well as initialing connections and sending files.

## Message Terminal
The messsage terminal is a way of sending encrypted messages between the client and server.
It has two initialization methods (for client and server) that sets up the encryption.
The initialization methods will return None if there is no error.

###### For the client:
'''

s = #socket code not shown

s.connect((HOST, PORT))

mt = MessageTerminal(s)

mt.initializeAsClient()

mt.close()

'''

###### For the server:
'''

s = #socket code not shown

s.bind((HOST, PORT))

s.listen()

conn, addr = s.accept()

mt = MessageTerminal(conn)

mt.initializeAsServer()

mt.close()

'''

## File Utilites
'''

extractFileBinary(filePath) #reads file binary

writeFileBinary(filePath, data) #write file binary

'''

## Pre defined messages
Standard messages that are used for setting up the server, sending files, and errors.
'''
