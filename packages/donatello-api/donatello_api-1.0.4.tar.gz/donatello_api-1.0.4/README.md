## Quickstart

Before you start, you need to take a couple of steps
1) First you need to create a Donatello token and enable the API functionality, all this can be done in your account on the API page
2) You need to install the library via `pip install donatello-api`

### Get me as User

If you need to get information about the user with which you authenticated through a token, then this can be done through the convenient `get_me()` method

```python

from donatello_api import Donatello


token = "<YOUR TOKEN HERE>"
client = Donatello(token)

me = client.get_me()

# print your account nickname
print(me.nickname)

```

### Get donations

You may need to get a list of your donations, and there is a `get_donates()` method specifically for this, which will return you a convenient list of them

```python

from donatello_api import Donatello


token = "<YOUR TOKEN HERE>"
client = Donatello(token)

# size = 5 - get 5 last donates
donates = client.get_donates(size = 5)

for donate in donates:
    print(f"{donate.client_name}: {donate.message}")

```
    
### Get top donators

You can get top donators using the `get_clients` method

```python

from donatello_api import Donatello


token = "<YOUR TOKEN HERE>"
client = Donatello(token)

donators = client.get_clients()

for donator in donators:
    print(f"{donator.client_name}: {donator.total_amount}")


```
