# PyParagraph

## Knuth Plass line-breaking for Python, with PIL rendering

This package is an attempt to make it easy to render paragraphs to a PIL Image in Python, with excellent line-breaking via the [Knuth-Plass algorithm](http://www.eprg.org/G53DOC/pdfs/knuth-plass-breaking.pdf). This algorithm is used by TeX and LaTeX, and is commonly called the TeX line-breaking algorithm or the LaTeX line-breaking algorithm). A simple greedy wrapping algorithm is available as a fallback. Console/text output is supported as well as PIL output.

Thanks to Bram Stein for inspiration, via [his JavaScript implementation](https://github.com/bramstein/typeset/) of the algoritm.

Example, typeset with the na√Øve greedy line-breaking algorithm:

![An image of a paragraph, typeset with a greedy algoritm](/images/tom_sawyer_greedy.png "Tom Sawyer Excerpt: Greedy Linebreaking")

The same, typeset with Knuth-Plass. Note the more even line-lengths:

## Usage

Simple command-line examples, either after installation or from the `src/` directory in the tree:

`python -m pyparagraph -f ../data/tom_sawyer.txt -i tom_sawyer.png`

Render wrapped text from `../data/tom_sawyer.txt` to image `tom_sawyer.png`, in default font and size.

`python -m pyparagraph -f ../data/tom_sawyer.txt --font Calibri --margin 20 --font-size 24pt --width 600 --image tom_sawyer.png`

Generates the image `tom_sawyer.png` from the text in the file `tom_sawyer.txt`, using 24pt Calibri as the font, on a 640px wide image (600px of text width, with 20 px margins on each side). The image will be as tall as needed to contain the text and margins.

Simple library example
```python
from pyparagraph import TextWrap

args = {
    "font": "Lato",
    "font-size": "24px",
    "width": "600"
}

text = """Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this."""

# Render to a file of the given name
textwrap = TextWrap.text_wrapper(args)
textwrap.render_image(text, filename="gettysburg.png", margin=20)


# Render to a PIL Image:

from PIL import Image
our_image = Image.new("RGBA", (800,800), "white")

textwrap.render_image(text, img=our_image)
our_image.save("gettysburg2.png")
```
## Requirements

This requires [the PyHyphen package](https://github.com/dr-leo/PyHyphen) by Dr. Leo for hyphenation (which is optional). "pip install pyhyphen" should install it. The first time you run with hyphenation for a given language, it will fetch the hyphenation library for that language.

The [matplotlib package](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib) is optional but allows much nicer font support.
