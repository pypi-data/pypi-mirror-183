# googletrans-mxloli-ver



This is a fork of the [googletrans](https://github.com/ssut/py-googletrans) which makes the original package compatible with the latest versions of `httpx`, `httpcore` and their dependencies. This compatibility makes it possible to use `httpx`'s newer versions than `0.13.3`.



The base is taken from the [feature/rpc](https://github.com/ssut/py-googletrans/tree/feature/rpc) branch of googletrans which was the last version, including pre-releases.



Comparing with PyPI, the base uses [v4.0.0rc1](https://pypi.org/project/googletrans/4.0.0rc1/) which was the last version on pypi, including pre-releases.



> **Note**: I have no intention to add features or to maintain this project. I just modified this fork in relation to my personal project and this is my temporary solution to a temporary problem, hopefully.



As the original project ended with version `4.0.0rc1` (pre-release), this fork's versioning starts from `4.0.0` (stable release).



### What's changed in this version:

- ~~modified the `pronunciation` to print the contents of `origin_pronunciation` . So basically instead of printing the contents of translated pronounciation, it instead prints out the contents of original language pronounciation. for example: if I translated to `JP -> EN:` it prints out the romanized version instead `小さな恋のうた -> Chīsanakoinōta` (like I've said this is intended for my personal project.)~~

- fixed the incompatible typing annotation for Python < 3.10
