    """Sweeps a 2D shape created from points connected with spline connections
    along a defined spline path to create a 3D CadQuery solid. Note, some
    variation in the cross-section of the solid may occur.

    Args:
        path_points: A list of XY, YZ or XZ coordinates connected by spline
            connections which define the path along which the 2D shape is
            swept.
        workplane: Workplane in which the 2D shape to be swept is defined.
            Defaults to "XY".
        path_workplane: Workplane in which the spline path is defined. Defaults
            to "XZ".
        force_cross_section (bool, optional): If True, cross-setion of solid
            is forced to be shape defined by points in workplane at each
            path_point. Defaults to False.
        color: the color to use when exporting the shape to CAD formats that
            support color. A tuple of three floats each ranging between 0
            and 1.
        name: the name of the shape, used to name files when exporting and
            as a legend in plots.
        translate: distance to translate / move the shape by. Specified as
            a vector of (X,Y,Z) directions.
