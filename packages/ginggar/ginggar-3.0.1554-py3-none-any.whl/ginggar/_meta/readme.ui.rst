Screen Structure
================

When you are logged in, you see the Ginggar main application. It always has a top bar with the main menu button. Right after login, you get the default screen, which shows a filter panel on the right side and a message list on the left side. If you use a mobile device, switch between them instead via the main menu.

The main menu also includes the *Feeds* and *Settings* options. While the latter is interesting for experts, the former one is the first step with a new account.

Feeds
=====

Ginggar works by fetching news messages from some web feeds. Those feeds have to comply to the rss or atom (or some more) standard. They are addressed by a http(s) url that you typically can find on the homepage of a feed provider. The feeds dialog is used for adding them to your Ginggar account.

Settings
========

The settings view allows to customize some aspects of Ginggar. Feel free to take a look there. Most things should be easy to understand.

Default View
============

The default view is made for browsing all the news that came from your feeds so far. It allows to attach tags to your messages for querying them later. One feed-specific tag is assigned automatically to each message for convenience.

In mobile device mode, you can switch between the list of your messages and between a panel that allows to filter this list (in order to make searches). In large mode, you see both.

Message List
------------

Each message has one box. You can expand them by selecting them. All actions on a message are available from here. You can remove them, mark them as favorite and manage it's tags. You can also open the corresponding web page in a new browser tab.

Some keyboard support is available. You will find some keyboard shortcuts in button tooltips.

Filter Panel
------------

By default, the message list shows all available messages. The filter panel allows to restrict that list by selecting some filter criteria.

You see a tag cloud in the filter panel, which allows you to filter by particular tags. Each checked tag will restrict your list further. Clear filter criteria for returning to a full list.

Store Filters
_____________

You can store your complete filter with a meaningful name and load it again in later sessions or set it as your default filter.
