## Editing with Markdown output

The [CKEditor 5 WYSIWYG](https://ckeditor.com/) editor lets you use this flexible yet simple markup language in the GitHub flavor. The editor-produced Markdown output supports the most important features, like [links](https://ckeditor.com/), **different** kinds of _emphasis_, `inline code formatting` or code blocks:

```css
p {
    text-align: center;
    color: red;
  }
```

## Formatting blocks with Markdown

Markdown can be used to create various block-level features, such as:

*   Block quotes
*   Headings
    1.  Heading 1
    2.  Heading 2
    3.  Heading 3
*   Lists, including nested ones
    *   Numbered lists
    *   Bulleted lists
    *   To-do lists

## Support for tables in Markdown

Bear in mind that Markdown has only very basic support for tables, so things like table styles or merged cells will not work.
