You can also view your archive as a seemless offline website 🦾\n\n## Installation\n\nTo install Yark, simply download Python 3.9+ and run the following:\n\n```shell\n$ pip3 install yark\n```\n\n## Managing your Archive\n\n\nOnce you\'ve installed Yark, think of a name for your archive and copy the target\'s channel id:\n\n```shell\n$ yark new owez https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSMdm6bUYIBN0KfS2CVuEPA\n```\n\nNow that you\'ve created the archive, you can tell Yark to download all videos and metadata:\n\n```shell\n$ yark refresh owez\n```\n\nHere\'s what my channel looked like after following the steps (if anything was updated/deleted it would be blue/red to indicate):\n\n<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Owez/yark/master/examples/images/report.png" alt="Report Demo" title="Report Demo" width="600" /></p>\n\n## Viewing your Archive\n\nViewing you archive is very simple, just type `view` and optionally the archive name:\n\n```shell\n$ yark view owez\n```\n\nThis will pop up an offline website in your browser letting you watch all videos 🚀\n\n<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Owez/yark/master/examples/images/channel.png" alt="Channel Demo" title="Channel Demo" /></p>\n\nUnder each video is a rich history report filled with graphs, as well as a noting feature which lets you add timestamped and permalinked comments 👐\n\n<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Owez/yark/master/examples/images/history.png" alt="History Demo" title="History Demo" /></p>\n\n## Details\n\nHere are some things to keep in mind when using Yark; the good and the bad:\n\n- Don\'t create a new archive again if you just want to update it, Yark accumulates all new metadata for you via timestamps\n- Feel free to suggest new features via the issues tab on this repository\n- Scheduling isn\'t a feature just yet, please use [`cron`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron) or something similar!\n',
