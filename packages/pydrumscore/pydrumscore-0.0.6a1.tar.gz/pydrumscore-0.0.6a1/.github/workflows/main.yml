      # Note: TestPyPI does not allow "node" tag names, such as "+g1234.d0000" at the end of versions.
      #       Therefore, we only use dev versions for snapshot versions (ex. 1.2.3.dev5). This, however, can cause name clashes.
      #       There is an option to force an overwrite of packages on TestPyPI on name clash, but this can cause unpredictability as to package content.
      #       The job is thus set on "allow to fail", with the dev package being a courtesy upload that may or may not work depending on success/failure
      #
      #       This workflow might become unviable if the project gets a decent amount of contributors. In this case, remove this section.
