## Overview

jaxdf is a [JAX](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)-based package defining a coding framework for writing differentiable numerical simulators with arbitrary discretizations.

The intended use is to build numerical models of physical systems, such as wave propagation, or the numerical solution of partial differential equations, that are easy to customize to the user's research needs. Such models are pure functions that can be included into arbitray differentiable programs written in [JAX](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/stable/): for example, they can be used as layers of neural networks, or to build a physics loss function.

<br/>

## Example

The following script builds the non-linear operator **(âˆ‡<sup>2</sup> + sin)**, using a Fourier spectral discretization on a square 2D domain, and uses it to define a loss function whose gradient is evaluated using JAX Automatic Differentiation.


```python
from jaxdf import operators as jops
from jaxdf import FourierSeries, operator
from jaxdf.geometry import Domain
from jax import numpy as jnp
from jax import jit, grad


# Defining operator
@operator
def custom_op(u):
  grad_u = jops.gradient(u)
  diag_jacobian = jops.diag_jacobian(grad_u)
  laplacian = jops.sum_over_dims(diag_jacobian)
  sin_u = jops.compose(u)(jnp.sin)
  return laplacian + sin_u

# Defining discretizations
domain = Domain((128, 128), (1., 1.))
parameters = jnp.ones((128,128,1))
u = FourierSeries(parameters, domain)

# Define a differentiable loss function
@jit
def loss(u):
  v = custom_op(u)
  return jnp.mean(jnp.abs(v.on_grid)**2)

gradient = grad(loss)(u) # gradient is a FourierSeries
```

## Installation

Before installing `jaxdf`, make sure that [you have installed JAX](https://github.com/google/jax#installation). Follow the instruction to install JAX with NVidia GPU support if you want to use `jaxdf` on the GPUs.

You can install `jaxdf` from PyPI using `pip`:

```bash
pip install jaxdf
```

For development, install jaxdf by cloning the repository or downloading and extracting the compressed archive. Then navigate in the root folder in a terminal, and run
```bash
pip install -r .requirements/requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```
to install the dependencies and the package itself (in editable mode).
