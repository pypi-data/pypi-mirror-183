# # Example:

# class ListComponent:
#
#     # the name of the component
#     name = 'list'
#
#     # types of values that the component can get as input.
#     # allowed are 'object', 'array', 'string', 'int', 'float', 'bool'
#     # To specify an array of strings, use 'array[string]'

#     # If the component can render member components (for example, object its members),
#     # specify in which properties of oarepo:ui these member components are referenced

#     # jinja template name to render the component
#     jinja_template = ''

#     # react stuff to render the component
