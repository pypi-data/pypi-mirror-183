# IPHYRE
The `iphyre` package is built to explore interactive physical reasoning.

## Introduction
IPHYRE benchmark contains 40 interactive physics games composed mainly of gray blocks, black blocks, blue blacks, and red balls. These games share the same goal of getting the red balls into the abyss, which can be reached by eliminating gray blocks (the only ones that can be eliminated). Besides the fixed static blocks (gray and black), we add dynamic blue blocks moving under gravity, springs, and pendulum bars to the environment to extensively enrich the physical dynamics.

## API
Some useful APIs are provided in iphyre.
* **iphyre.games.GAMES:** Get the names of all the games.
* **iphyre.games.PARAS:** Get the design parameters of all the games.
* **iphyre.simulator.reset():** Reset the bodyies in the game and return the initial state.
* **iphyre.simulator.step():** Apply an action and forward a timestep. Return the next state, reward and done.
* **iphyre.simulator.simulate():** Simulate the game with the specified actions and only return the final results without a UI.
* **iphyre.simulator.simulate_vis():** Simulate the game with the specified actions and display in a UI.
