class SimulatorManager:
    """
    This class defines the simulation logic. It contains all the methods and components that are needed
    to run the acoustic simulation in the defined scenario, and compute the output signals. The
    acoustic scene defined in the `Environment` module contains a single sound source, an array of microphones, 
    and some additional parameters (e.g. a sampling frequency, the atmospheric conditions, the road surface properties,
    a background noise). The `SimulatorManager` simulates the propagation of sound from the moving source to a 
    single, static microphone, exploiting the scene parameters that it receives at the time of its initialization.

    The received signal will contain two different components: the direct sound, propagating directly from 
    the source (assumed to be omnidirectional and point-like) to the microphone (assumed
    to be omnidirectional and point-like too), and the sound reflected by the road surface. In order to simulate the
    reflection, the simulator exploits the Image-Source Method (ISM): a virtual source is generated by reflecting the
    position of the real sound source w.r.t the road surface, and the reflected sound is assumed to be emitted by
    this source as if it was emitting in the free-field. The sound produced the image source is then filtered by a 
    set of FIR filters that simulate the asphalt surface absorption and the attenuation due to the propagation of
    the sound through the air.
    
    The simulation is divided in two separate phases:
    * During the `initialization` phase, the `DelayLine` components used to simulate the sound propagation delay
    are instantiated, and the initial delays between the microphone, the sound source and the reflection point are
    computed.
    * During the `update` phase, first the signal emitted by the source is written on the two `DelayLine` instances 
    controlling the direct and reflected sound propagation delays. Then, the delays are updated according to the 
    new position of the moving source, together with the distances source -> receiver, image source -> road surface 
    and road surface -> receiver. The corresponding delayed signal samples are read from the `DelayLines` and filtered
    via a set of filters simulating the (angle-dependent) asphalt reflection and the air absorption. Finally, the
    signal received by the microphone is computed by summing the direct and the reflected components of the simulated
    sound field.

        Creates a `SimulatorManager` object containing all the methods and attributes required to run the acoustic
        simulation. When the constructor is called, the environmental parameters previously defined in the object
        `Environment` are stored into the simulator manager (c, fs, Z0, road_material, airAbsorptionCoefficients). 
        In addition, the two `DelayLine` objects required for the simulation are instantiated as empty circular 
        arrays with 48000 entries. The `asphaltReflectionFilterTable` is pre-computed and stored as an instance 
        attribute containing the FIR filter coefficients that describe asphalt reflection at different angles of
        incidence of the sound waves. This will result in a reduction of the computational load,
        since the computation of a new filter depending on the instantaneous incidence angle is turned into a 
        table lookup. The set of considered incidence angles is stored in `_theta_vector` in degrees. In order to
        reduce the computational complexity, also the pseudo inverse matrix, needed by the least squares filter design
        method in the air absorption filters evaluation, is pre-computed. Finally, a set of auxiliary buffers are 
        instantiated and will be used for filtering purpose.

        This method is used to compute the output of one instant of the simulation. It takes as inputs the instantaneous
        positions of the source and of the microphone used in the current simulation, and the sample of the source
        signal emitted at the considered instant. It then performs the update of the `DelayLine` objects, writing the new 
        sample `signal_sample` on the primary line, and computes the relative distances and delays between the source,
        the road surface at the incidence point, and the microphone, together with the incidence angle. According to
        these delays, the `DelayLine` read pointers positions are updated. Then, the output sample received at the
        microphone position is computed as a sum of two components:
        * the direct component of the sound field, filtered with by air absorption filter ,depending on the distance
        between the source and the microphone, and attenuated depending on the travelled distance;
        * the reflected component: the reflected sound is analyzed using a cascade of 3 filters and two multiplications.
        The reflected sound wave travels from the source to the road surface, along a trajectory computed 
        using the principles of geometrical acoustics. This path is represented by a propagation delay, a filter that
        models the air absorption depending on the distance between the source and the incidence point, and an
        attenuation factor depending on the same travelled distance. At the incidence point, the sound wave is 
        filtered with a second FIR filter representing the asphalt reflection, depending on the road surface material 
        and on the incidence angle. After the reflection, the sound wave travels from the reflection point to the 
        microphone, along a path modeled by a second delay element, a second air absorption filter depending on the
        distance between reflection point and microphone, and a second attenuation factor depending on the same
        distance. 

        The two components are summed to produce the output sample, that is returned by the update function. All the 
        filtering operations are performed in the time domain, as the convolution between the considered signals 
        and the FIR filters.
