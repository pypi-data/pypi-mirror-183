# OpenADRVen Agent


[![Passing?](https://github.com/VOLTTRON/volttron-openadr-ven/actions/workflows/run-tests.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/VOLTTRON/volttron-openadr-ven/actions/workflows/run-tests.yml)
[![pypi version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/volttron-openadr-ven.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/volttron-openadr-ven/)


OpenADR (Automated Demand Response) is a standard for alerting and responding to the need to adjust electric power consumption in response to fluctuations in grid demand.


# Prerequisites


* Python 3.8


# Installation


1. Create and activate a virtual environment.

   ```shell
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate
   ```

1. Install volttron and start the platform.

    ```shell
    pip install volttron


    # Start platform with output going to volttron.log
    volttron -vv -l volttron.log &
    ```

1.  Install and start the Volttron OpenADRVen Agent.


    ```shell
    vctl install volttron-openadr-ven --agent-config <path to agent config> \
    --vip-identity openadr.ven \
    --start
    ```

1. View the status of the installed agent


    ```shell
    vctl status
    ```

1. Observe Data

    The OpenADR publishes events on the message bus. To see these events in the Volttron log file, install a [Listener Agent](https://pypi.org/project/volttron-listener/):


    ```
    vctl install volttron-listener --start
    ```


    Once installed, you should see the data being published by viewing the Volttron logs file that was created in step 2.

    To watch the logs, open a separate terminal and run the following command:


    ```
    tail -f <path to folder containing volttron.log>/volttron.log
    ```


# Agent Configuration


The required parameters for this agent are "ven_name" and "vtn_url". Below is an example of a correct configuration with optional parameters added.


```json
    {
        "ven_name": "PNNLVEN",
        "vtn_url": "https://eiss2demo.ipkeys.com/oadr2/OpenADR2/Simple/2.0b",
        "cert_path": "~/.ssh/secret/TEST_RSA_VEN_210923215148_cert.pem",
        "key_path": "~/.ssh/secret/TEST_RSA_VEN_210923215148_privkey.pem",
        "debug": true,
        "disable_signature": true
    }
```


Save this configuration in a JSON file in your preferred location. An example of such a configuration is saved in the
root of this repository; the file is named `config_example1.json`
