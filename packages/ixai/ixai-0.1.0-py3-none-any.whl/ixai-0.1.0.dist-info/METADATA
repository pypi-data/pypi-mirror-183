# ixai: Incremental Explainable Artificial Intelligence

This is the first iteration of our incremental explanation package.

Currently, it includes two explanation methods: PFI and SAGE.

Please look at the examples in the `examples` directory.

Please help us in improving our work by contributing or pointing to issues. We will update this iteration soon with further information.

## Installation
ixai is intended to work with **Python 3.9 and above**. Installation can be done with `pip`:

```sh
pip install ixai
```
