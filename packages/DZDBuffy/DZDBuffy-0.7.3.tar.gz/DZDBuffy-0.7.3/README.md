## What is this?

___

Buffy is a server/client framework to buffer/cache your http requests.  
Buffy decouples your dependency on external webservers that are not under your control.  
Buffy manages HTTP downloads in the background. 
You can ignore any issues with external webservers and just focus on your application.  

## Features

___

* Caching of remote http resources (a.k.a. `files you downloaded from the web`)
* Versioning of remote http resources 
* Managing of remote http resources with grouping, tagging and pinning
* Background pre-download of remote http resources
* "Smart"-Downloader
    * Resume broken downloads
    * Retry corrupted downloads

## Intended purpose

* Make your software resiliant against changing (transformation,discontinuation,outage,...) external http resources
* Dampen load on external servers - prevent `429 Too Many Requests` errors
* Pre-cache long running downloads before you need them


## Clients

At the moment there is only a [python client library](https://pypi.org/project/DZDBuffy/).  
But the Buffy-server has a [REST API](https://dzd-ev.github.io/buffy-docs.github.io/buffyserver-api/) that can be consumed from any coding language. 

**You are very welcome to contribute a client in your language  ðŸ‘‹ðŸ˜ƒ**
## Quick Start Client

___

Lets have a small example how your Buffy client code could look like.

### Install Buffy

```bash
pip install DZDBuffy
```

### Example

Lets write some code using the Buffy client


```python
from buffy.buffypyclient import BuffyPyClient

# connect to Buffy-server
c = BuffyPyClient(ssl=False)

# create a request
req = c.create_request(
    url="https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/baseline/pubmed22n0003.xml.gz"
)

# save requested file
req.download_response_content_to(dir="/tmp")
```

This is all it takes to request a file. Next time the webserver at `ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.go`  should be down the buffy client will just serve you the cached answer.
Should your Buffy-server be down, the client will fall back to direct downloading the request from the source.

See the [documenation](https://dzd-ev.github.io/buffy-docs.github.io/BuffyPyClient-examples/) for more detailed examples on how to use the client


## Quick Start Server

___

### Requirements

* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
* [Docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/compose-plugin/)

### Server start

* Download the buffy docker-compose file 

```bash
wget -O docker-compose.yaml https://git.connect.dzd-ev.de/dzdpythonmodules/buffy/-/raw/main/docker-compose.yaml?inline=false
```

* Start the Buffy-server with docker compose

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### Connecting the BuffyPyClient

Create a python script. 

```python
# connect to Buffy-server
from buffy.buffypyclient import BuffyPyClient

# connect to Buffy-server
c = BuffyPyClient(host="localhost", port=8008, ssl=False)
```

See the [documentation](https://dzd-ev.github.io/buffy-docs.github.io/BuffyPyClient-examples/) for more detailed examples on how to use the client
