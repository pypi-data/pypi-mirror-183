## [1.2.0] 02-01-2023
## Fixed
- Bug: Handle exception when media attachments are geoblocked (403 Unauthorized)
- Regression: Take into account new structure of Twitter's archive (tweet.js changed to tweets.js)
- Bug: Handle special media types that don't include link to media in some cases. Thanks @tewhalen!
- Bug: Align max_tweets minimum value (10) with the warning message and actual value. Thanks @nemobis!
- Bug: Multiple video attachments cause HTTP 422 on Mastodon when posting.
- Bug: Exception when post was manually pinned on the Fedi account and later one was pinned on the Twitter account. Thanks @selyod-ka!

## Enhancements
- Archive offline support, you no longer need a Twitter developer account or access to their API to process an archive.
- Mastodon limits, make URLs count as 23 characters (or the instance configured value) when determining if truncating is necessary
- Added progress bars when gathering, processing and posting tweets
- Pleroma and Mastodon rate limits, handle HTTP 429 more gracefully (wait until they reset and continue)

## Added
- RSS support, you can now use an RSS feed as a source of tweets to post. Take a look at the docs for more info.
- Thread support, now mirrored users should be able to reply to their own posts and create reply threads.
- Native retweet support, now users in your config should be able to reblog their own and each other's posts if they are on the same instance.
- `bot` config mapping, for setting the [bot flag](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/user/profile/#bot) on the target account.
- `--lockerfile` argument, for specifying the path of the locker file that prevents collisions between multiple concurrent bot executions.
- `guest` mapping, for enabling the use of Guest Tokens (so you don't need a Twitter Developer account). If no `twitter_token` is present in your config it will default to `true`
- `proxy_pool` mapping, list of proxies to use when being rate limited with Guest Tokens 
- `proxy` mapping, for enabling or disabling the use of proxies when using guest tokens
- Caching IDs of posts published and skip mirroring tweet if associated published post is found to avoid duplicates. You can change this with the `avoid_duplicates` mapping.
- `application_name` mapping, for specifying the Fediverse application name to use as a filter when getting the date of the latest published post by the bot. Thanks @reorx!
- Configuration wizard, which generates a minimal config if none is found
- `content_warnings`, for specifying keywords that if found will add a content warning to the Fediverse post
- `custom_replacements` for replacing any text (Twitter handles that differ from the Fedi handle, for example) Thanks @selyod-ka!
- `software` config mapping, for sidestepping the automatic detection of the type of software (mastodon, pleroma, misskey) running on the target instance and forcing a specific value. If your target is a fork of another project, for example, you would be able to force the bot to use whichever software (mastodon, pleroma, misskey) is the closest match for their API.

## [1.1.0] 06-06-2022
## Fixed
- Bug: Tweet media getting dropped if one of the attachments returned 404 Not Found
- Regression: `visibility`'s value not being honored when defined as a global mapping in the config
- Bug: Handle exception when the tweet is empty (no attachments, polls or body) due to dropping malformed attachments
- Bug: Handle exception when expanded URL is unreachable or returns any code other than 200
- Regression: Not asking for date when passing a specific Twitter username with `--forceDate`

- Bug: Truncating when exceeding post max length resulted in signature links being broken if original date was enabled
- Bug: Videos not being mirrored in some cases with extended tweets 

## Enhancements
- Target instance's character limits when posting are taken into account and posts text are truncated if necessary
- The rest of the users of the config are processed, even if another one fails (errors will be logged accordingly and pleroma-bot will exit with non-zero exit code)
- Recover from hitting rate limits for Twitter's API (HTTP 429 Too Many Requests)
- Twitter bio links are now expanded by default if the Fedi instance bio's maximum length is not exceeded
- Maximum number of attachments allowed per post are now taken into account depending on the instance type (Mastodon, Pleroma or Misskey)
- Alt text/Image descriptions are now mirrored on the Fediverse post image description/comment

## Added
- `include_quotes` config mapping, for including or excluding quoted tweets
- `random_user_order` global config mapping, for randomizing the order in which users are processed
