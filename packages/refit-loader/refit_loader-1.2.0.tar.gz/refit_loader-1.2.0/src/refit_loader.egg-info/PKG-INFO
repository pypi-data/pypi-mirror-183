# REFIT Loader
> This project uses **Dask Dataframes** to ease and fasten the process of loading all the data of REFIT and provides functionalities to transform and manipulate the REFIT dataset for statistical analysis purpose.


## REFIT dataset
An electrical load measurements dataset of United Kingdom households from a two-year longitudinal study. Sci Data 4, 160122 (2017). <br />
Murray, D., Stankovic, L. & Stankovic, V.  <br />

## Dependencies
Ensure that the following dependencies are satisfied either in your current environment 
```
  - python=3.9.2
  - numpy=1.20.3
  - pandas=1.2.4
  - dask=2021.06.2
  - json=2.0.9
  - sklearn=1.1.2
```
or create a new environment using 'environment.yml'
```
conda create env --file=environment.yml
conda activate refit_loader_env
```


# Steps to implement this project
1) Use this repository as a submodule and clone it into your target source project
```
git submodule add https://github.com/mahnoor-shahid/refit_loader.git
```

2) Make sure the 'config.json' file has the correct DATA_FOLDER path; [Download](#downloads) the dataset and it should be located in this data folder.
```
{ 
    "DATA_FOLDER" : "data/refit/",
    "DATA_TYPE" : ".csv",
    "README_FILE" : "refit_loader/REFIT_Readme.txt",
    "REFIT_HOUSES" : [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,15,16,17,18,19,20,21]
}
```

3) Take the reference from Refit_Analyzer to see how Refit_Loader can be accessed as a submodule and how it's utilities can be used.

Reference Repository: <br />
[Refit Analyzer](https://github.com/mahnoor-shahid/refit_analyzer) = REFIT analyzer is more like a user guide that uses REFIT Loader as a submodule and demonstrates how it can be used and how it can be useful with its utilities.
