## Dependencies
Ensure that the following dependencies are satisfied either in your current environment 
```  
  - python>=3.9.2
  - numpy>=1.20.3
  - pandas>=1.2.4
  - dask>=2021.06.2
  - scikit-learn>=1.1.2
```
or create a new environment using 'environment.yml'
```
conda create env --file=environment.yml
conda activate refit_loader_env
```


## Getting Started
1) Install the refit-loader in your current target environment
```
pip install refit-loader
```

2) [Download](#downloads) the refit dataset. Import the REFIT_Loader and pass the data path to the refit object.
```
from refit_loader.data_loader import REFIT_Loader
refit = REFIT_Loader(data_path='')
```
3) Fetch the list of available appliances for selected houses.
```
refit.get_appliance_names(house=2)
```
4) Load data for selected appliance (all houses)
```
kettle = refit.get_appliance_data(appliance='Kettle')
```
5) (OR) Load data for selected house (all appliances).
```
house2 = refit.get_house_data(house=2)
```
6) (OR) Load data for sselected appliance and elected houses.
```
kettle = refit.get_appliance_data(appliance="Kettle", houses=[1,2,3])
```
7) Take the reference from Refit_Analyzer to see how Refit_Loader can be accessed and how it's utilities can be used.

Reference Repository: <br />
[Refit Analyzer](https://github.com/mahnoor-shahid/refit_analyzer) = REFIT analyzer is more like a user guide that uses REFIT Loader as a submodule and demonstrates how it can be used and how it can be useful with its utilities.
