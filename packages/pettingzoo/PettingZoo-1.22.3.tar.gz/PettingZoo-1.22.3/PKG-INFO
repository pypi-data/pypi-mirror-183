PettingZoo is a Python library for conducting research in multi-agent reinforcement learning, akin to a multi-agent version of [Gymnasium](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Gymnasium).

The documentation website is at [pettingzoo.farama.org](https://pettingzoo.farama.org) and we have a public discord server (which we also use to coordinate development work) that you can join here: https://discord.gg/nhvKkYa6qX

## Environments

PettingZoo includes the following families of environments:

* [Atari](https://pettingzoo.farama.org/environments/atari/): Multi-player Atari 2600 games (cooperative, competitive and mixed sum)
* [Butterfly](https://pettingzoo.farama.org/environments/butterfly): Cooperative graphical games developed by us, requiring a high degree of coordination
* [Classic](https://pettingzoo.farama.org/environments/classic): Classical games including card games, board games, etc.
* [MPE](https://pettingzoo.farama.org/environments/mpe): A set of simple nongraphical communication tasks, originally from https://github.com/openai/multiagent-particle-envs
* [SISL](https://pettingzoo.farama.org/environments/sisl): 3 cooperative environments, originally from https://github.com/sisl/MADRL
