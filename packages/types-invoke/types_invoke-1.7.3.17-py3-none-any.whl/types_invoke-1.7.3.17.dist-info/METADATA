## Typing stubs for invoke

This is a PEP 561 type stub package for the `invoke` package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like mypy, PyCharm, pytype etc. to check code
that uses `invoke`. The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/invoke. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md for more details.
This package was generated from typeshed commit `5fb21861f9f389ed18ab2e52bc4bcc156f357f55`.
