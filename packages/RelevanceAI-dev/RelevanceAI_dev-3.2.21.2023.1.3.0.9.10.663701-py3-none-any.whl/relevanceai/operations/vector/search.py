        Allows you to leverage vector similarity search to create a semantic search engine. Powerful features of Relevance vector search:

        1. Multivector search that allows you to search with multiple vectors and give each vector a different weight.
        e.g. Search with a product image vector and text description vector to find the most similar products by what it looks like and what its described to do.
        You can also give weightings of each vector field towards the search, e.g. image_vector_ weights 100%, whilst description_vector_ 50% \n
            An example of a simple multivector query:

            >>> [
            >>>     {"vector": [0.12, 0.23, 0.34], "fields": ["name_vector_"], "alias":"text"},
            >>>     {"vector": [0.45, 0.56, 0.67], "fields": ["image_vector_"], "alias":"image"},
            >>> ]

            An example of a weighted multivector query:

            >>> [
            >>>     {"vector": [0.12, 0.23, 0.34], "fields": {"name_vector_":0.6}, "alias":"text"},
            >>>     {"vector": [0.45, 0.56, 0.67], "fields": {"image_vector_"0.4}, "alias":"image"},
            >>> ]

            An example of a weighted multivector query with multiple fields for each vector:

            >>> [
            >>>     {"vector": [0.12, 0.23, 0.34], "fields": {"name_vector_":0.6, "description_vector_":0.3}, "alias":"text"},
            >>>     {"vector": [0.45, 0.56, 0.67], "fields": {"image_vector_"0.4}, "alias":"image"},
            >>> ]

        2. Utilise faceted search with vector search. For information on how to apply facets/filters check out datasets.documents.get_where \n
        3. Sum Fields option to adjust whether you want multiple vectors to be combined in the scoring or compared in the scoring. e.g. image_vector_ + text_vector_ or image_vector_ vs text_vector_. \n
            When sum_fields=True:

            - Multi-vector search allows you to obtain search scores by taking the sum of these scores.
            - TextSearchScore + ImageSearchScore = SearchScore
            - We then rank by the new SearchScore, so for searching 1000 documents there will be 1000 search scores and results

            When sum_fields=False:

            - Multi vector search but not summing the score, instead including it in the comparison!
            - TextSearchScore = SearchScore1
            - ImagSearchScore = SearchScore2
            - We then rank by the 2 new SearchScore, so for searching 1000 documents there should be 2000 search scores and results.

        4. Personalization with positive and negative document ids.

            - For more information about the positive and negative document ids to personalize check out services.recommend.vector

        approximation_depth: int
            Used for approximate search to speed up search. The higher the number, faster the search but potentially less accurate.
        sum_fields : bool
            Whether to sum the multiple vectors similarity search score as 1 or seperate
        page_size: int
            Size of each page of results
        page: int
            Page of the results
        similarity_metric: string
            Similarity Metric, choose from ['cosine', 'l1', 'l2', 'dp']
        facets: list
            Fields to include in the facets, if [] then all
        filters: list
            Query for filtering the search results
        min_score: int
            Minimum score for similarity metric
        include_vector: bool
            Include vectors in the search results
        include_count: bool
            Include the total count of results in the search results
        asc: bool
            Whether to sort results by ascending or descending order
        keep_search_history: bool
            Whether to store the history into Relevance. This will increase the storage costs over time.
        hundred_scale: bool
            Whether to scale up the metric by 100
        first_step_multivector_query: list
            Query for advance search that allows for multiple vector and field querying.
        first_step_page: int
            Page of the results
        first_step_page_size: int
            Size of each page of results
        query: string
            What to store as the query name in the dashboard
