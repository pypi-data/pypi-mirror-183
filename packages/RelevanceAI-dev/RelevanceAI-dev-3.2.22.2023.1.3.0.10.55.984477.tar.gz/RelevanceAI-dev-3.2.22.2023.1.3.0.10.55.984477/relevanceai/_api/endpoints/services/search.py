        Allows you to leverage vector similarity search to create a semantic search engine. Powerful features of Relevance vector search:

        1. Multivector search that allows you to search with multiple vectors and give each vector a different weight.
        e.g. Search with a product image vector and text description vector to find the most similar products by what it looks like and what its described to do.
        You can also give weightings of each vector field towards the search, e.g. image_vector_ weights 100%, whilst description_vector_ 50% \n
            An example of a simple multivector query:

            >>> [
            >>>     {"vector": [0.12, 0.23, 0.34], "fields": ["name_vector_"], "alias":"text"},
            >>>     {"vector": [0.45, 0.56, 0.67], "fields": ["image_vector_"], "alias":"image"},
            >>> ]

            An example of a weighted multivector query:

            >>> [
            >>>     {"vector": [0.12, 0.23, 0.34], "fields": {"name_vector_":0.6}, "alias":"text"},
            >>>     {"vector": [0.45, 0.56, 0.67], "fields": {"image_vector_"0.4}, "alias":"image"},
            >>> ]

            An example of a weighted multivector query with multiple fields for each vector:

            >>> [
            >>>     {"vector": [0.12, 0.23, 0.34], "fields": {"name_vector_":0.6, "description_vector_":0.3}, "alias":"text"},
            >>>     {"vector": [0.45, 0.56, 0.67], "fields": {"image_vector_"0.4}, "alias":"image"},
            >>> ]

        2. Utilise faceted search with vector search. For information on how to apply facets/filters check out datasets.documents.get_where \n
        3. Sum Fields option to adjust whether you want multiple vectors to be combined in the scoring or compared in the scoring. e.g. image_vector_ + text_vector_ or image_vector_ vs text_vector_. \n
            When sum_fields=True:

            - Multi-vector search allows you to obtain search scores by taking the sum of these scores.
            - TextSearchScore + ImageSearchScore = SearchScore
            - We then rank by the new SearchScore, so for searching 1000 documents there will be 1000 search scores and results

            When sum_fields=False:

            - Multi vector search but not summing the score, instead including it in the comparison!
            - TextSearchScore = SearchScore1
            - ImagSearchScore = SearchScore2
            - We then rank by the 2 new SearchScore, so for searching 1000 documents there should be 2000 search scores and results.

        4. Personalization with positive and negative document ids.

            - For more information about the positive and negative document ids to personalize check out services.recommend.vector

        Chunks are data that has been divided into different units. e.g. A paragraph is made of many sentence chunks, a sentence is made of many word chunks, an image frame in a video.

An example of a document with chunks:

        Performs a vector hybrid search and then an advanced chunk search. Chunk Search allows one to search through chunks inside a document. The major difference between chunk search and normal search in Vector AI is that it relies on the chunkvector field. Chunk Vector Search. Search with a multiple chunkvectors for the most similar documents. Chunk search also supports filtering to only search through filtered results and facets to get the overview of products available when a minimum score is set. \n

        Example 1 (Hybrid chunk search):
