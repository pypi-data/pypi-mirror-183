HP-87 Matrix ROM Sources Rev.A

Based on the files provided in the HP-85 emulator (Everett Kaser)
in disc images: disc1/87 MATRIX SRC 1A, 87 MATRIX SRC 1B, 87 MATRIX SRC 2

The sources have been updated by:
- commenting out the UNL pseudo-opcodes to get the full assembly listing,
- aligning the ROM1 source code with the actual 00087-15004 REV.A Matrix ROM 1 binary:
  there are actually just a few changes, reason is unknown, but it could be:
    typing errors for two of them: use of R0 instead of R10,
    an attempt to by-pass the self-test, maybe because the checksum after re-assembly was wrong,
    and the inclusion of a change maybe from the hypothetical ver.B, since the ROM1-3 file was only present in the SRC 1B disc image.
The sources have been assembled with the HP-87 Asssembler ROM.
